# Magnetic Cave Game

Welcome to the Magnetic Cave Game repository! This project is part of the ENCS3340 course at Birzeit University. The game is an adversarial 2-player strategy game where players compete to form a bridge of 5 consecutive bricks on an 8x8 board. The game is built with Python and allows play between humans or against a computer AI using the minimax algorithm.

## Game Description

Magnetic Cave is played on an 8x8 chessboard with two types of magnetic bricks represented by '■' and '□'. Players place bricks on the board, starting with '■'. The goal is to put five consecutive bricks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Bricks can only be placed adjacent to another brick or against the board’s magnetic walls.

## Features

- **Two Play Modes:**
  - Manual vs. Manual: Both players make their moves manually.
  - Manual vs. AI: Play against an AI that uses the minimax algorithm to make decisions.

- **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements minimax for decision-making in AI mode, optimized to run within a 3-second move limit.
  
- **Simple GUI:** Utilizes Python's tkinter library to provide a graphical interface for game interaction.
